# Delhi Metro Operations Case Study

The problem I worked on is my take on a problem statement I found at [Statso](https://statso.io/delhi-metro-operations-case-study/).

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains several files, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Agency**  
   Details about the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, including name, URL, and contact information.

2. **Calendar**  
   Service schedules specifying operation days (weekdays, weekends) and the valid dates for these schedules.

3. **Routes**  
   Information about metro routes, including their short and long names, route types, and descriptions.

4. **Shapes**  
   Geographical coordinates defining the precise paths taken by the metro lines.

5. **Stop Times**  
   Timetables for trips, indicating the arrival and departure times at specific stops.

6. **Stops**  
   Details of metro stops, including latitude and longitude coordinates.

7. **Trips**  
   Information linking trips to their respective routes, including trip IDs and associated route IDs.

## Project Goals and Achievements

### Adjustments to Trip Schedules

- **Morning and Evening Peaks**  
  To handle higher demand during peak hours, I increased the number of trips by **20%**. This adjustment was made to reduce overcrowding and improve passenger comfort and reliability.

- **Midday and Late Evening**  
  During off-peak hours, I reduced the number of trips by **10%**. This helps utilize resources more efficiently while maintaining a good service level.

By implementing these adjustments, Delhi Metro can potentially improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, especially during peak hours.
